        <p class = "place"><em>Ulva Island</em> is a wildlife paradise</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/82/Ulva_Island_wharf_area.jpg/300px-Ulva_Island_wharf_area.jpg" width = "250">
        <p>When we broke off Gondwana millions of years ago, New Zealand’s ecology evolved without mammals. Only birds and a couple of bats. Because they evolved without mammal predators, many lost their ability to fly, like the iconic kiwi. Any mammals you meet here are introduced, and most are considered pests. The worst are Australian possums, stoats, weasels, feral cats, rats, mice, and even dogs.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/070308_Stewart_Island_robin_on_Ulva.jpg/486px-070308_Stewart_Island_robin_on_Ulva.jpg" width = "220" height = "220">
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Ulvadam.jpg/220px-Ulvadam.jpg" width = "220">
        <p>But because it’s a small island (combined with other factors) New Zealand is fighting back against predators. And it makes a real difference. So much hard work is going into protecting this ecological paradise. And the wildlife we do have is unlike anywhere else in the world.</p>
        <p>If you hear a sharp whistle on a mountain river, it could be the call of the whio/blue duck; there are only about 3,000 left and they are in decline. At dawn, the pitter-patter on the metal mountain hut roof might be a curious kea, the world’s only alpine parrot. The heavy woosh-woosh you might hear in the forest could be a fat kererū/wood pigeon taking flight.<br> 
        This is what makes New Zealand truly extraordinary in my eyes. And it’s a good reminder to protect what we have left.</p>
        
        <h3 id = "secondpost">Spain</h3>
        <h6>Posted on January 30, 2024</h6>
        <p class = "place">So, I really love <em>Madrid</em></p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Plaza_Mayor_de_Madrid_06.jpg" width = "250">
        <p>For me, Madrid is the heart of Spain and it’s a place I know really well. Geographically the center of the country, it’s also the center for travel and work and I pretty much am always passing through there over the years. It’s where many of my friends are and it’s a massive hub for expats. I know it well.</p>
        <p>For some reason Madrid doesn’t always have the best rep – people tend to compare it to Barcelona a lot. Madrid versus Barcelona is more than just an epic soccer rivalry, and tourists tend to love the flashy beachside Catalán capital a lot more than traditional Madrid. Having spent a lot of time in both, I can safely say I hate Barcelona and love Madrid.</p>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Madrid_MG_0514_%2839365149022%29.jpg" width = "220">
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Puerta_del_Sol_%28Madrid%29_10.jpg/1200px-Puerta_del_Sol_%28Madrid%29_10.jpg" width = "220">
        <p>For me, Madrid is the real Spain. It doesn’t get anymore Spanish than Madrid. With great food, amazing arts and culture, historic neighborhoods, adorable old man bats, fabulous shopping and super fun events, not to mention it’s the center for just about anywhere, Madrid a very livable lively city. I have so much nostalgia for it, especially in summer!</p> 
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Gran_V%C3%ADa_%28Madrid%29_1.jpg/1200px-Gran_V%C3%ADa_%28Madrid%29_1.jpg" width = "220">
        <p>There are so many reasons to love Madrid. Far from being any sort of clear guide of what to do or what not to do in Madrid on holiday, and since I have never really gone to Madrid for a holiday anyways, I thought I’d go ahead and share personal reasons for why I love Madrid, what keeps bringing me back there and where my favorite haunts are.</p>
